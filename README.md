# Raw WebGPU: JavaScript

Created by following Alain Galvan's [Raw WebGPU](https://alain.xyz/blog/raw-webgpu) tutorial.

Implemented in vanilla JavaScript rather than the TypeScript used in the article.
Set-up using Vite so that it can be easily expanded.

## Running

Clone the repo, then run the following commands.

```
# Install necessary packages
npm install

# Run the demo
npm run dev
```
